git-finder
==========

Small tool for checking if directories are git directories and the number of branches that are committed. Also an intro to Elixir for myself (feel free to give feedback!).

# Running

    mix escript.build                 # Build the executable
    ./gitfinder ~/dev/ ~/dev/project  # Run the tool
